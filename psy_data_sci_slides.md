# A tipping point

# Data science example

https://github.com/matthew-brett/psy-data-sci/brexit.ipynb

# Themes

* code at the heart of analysis;
* general programming language as foundation;
* reproducible;
* documented.

# The efficiency gap

# Excel: my part in its downfall

* 1986 - programming optional;
* 1996 - an uneasy truce;
* 2006 - the rise of R and Python;
* 2016 - Jupyter, Pandas, RStudio.

# Can we really teach code?

* understand what algorithms are, how they are implemented as programs on
  digital devices, and that programs execute by following precise and
  unambiguous instructions;
* create and debug simple programs;
* use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs
* use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and
  retrieve digital content

# What do we gain?

* change in culture;
* technical gains;
* deeper insight into algorithms.

# Change in culture

# Change in culture

> a\) Focus on finding a good solution - that's what consultants get paid
> for.
\hfill\break
> b\) Live with the data before you plunge into modeling.
\hfill\break
> c\) Search for a model that gives a good solution, either algorithmic or
> data.
\hfill\break
> d\) Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criterion for how good the model
> is.
\hfill\break
> e\) Computers are an indispensable partner

# A change in culture

> Computing results are now being presented in a very loose, “breezy” way—in
> journal articles, in conferences, and in books. All too often one simply
> takes computations at face value. This is spectacularly against the evidence
> of my own experience. I would much rather that at talks and in referee
> reports, the possibility of such error were seriously examined.

# Technical gains

* flexibility in data that can be analyzed (Twitter feeds, web pages,
  databases, geospatial data...);
* flexibility in data exploration, cleaning, visualization;
* flexibility in analysis methods;
* [large active online community](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/tags)

# Deeper insight with algorithms

Statistical reasoning is much easier to understand in terms of algorithms and
computation instead of mathematics [@cobb2015mere; @hesterberg2015teachers].
Courses should teach "computational thinking" [@temple_lang2015];

# Resampling statistics

Julian Simon [-@simon1997resampling] "Resampling, the new statistics" at
http://www.resample.com/intro-text-online.

Trials of teaching method in high school students [-@simon1969new] and
undergraduates [-@simon1976probability] including those with "low skills and
little interest in mathematics".

# Is this the end?

Yes, it's the end of the talk.
